# emissione-go

emissione-go is a small (no dependencies!) framework, which provide dynamic switching support for http response content types.

E.g. this allows you to transparently serve both XML and JSON output in your API.

All this is controlled via the [Accept](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept) header.

emissione-go is inspired by [senlinms/gores](https://github.com/senlinms/gores) and the render types of [gin-gonic/gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin).

Download:

```
go get github.com/kernle32dll/emissione-go
```

Detailed documentation can be found on [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/kernle32dll/emissione-go).

## Getting started

emissione-go provides two ways for getting started:

You can either use a opinionated default handler by using `emissione.Default()`, or define one yourself via `emissione.New(...)`.
The latter allows you to define a custom mapping, and a default handler. You can look at the source of `emissione.Default()` to get an idea.

Here is a quick example, using the defaults:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/kernle32dll/emissione-go"

	"log"
	"net/http"
)

// User is a just sample struct for showcasing.
type User struct {
	Name string `json:"name",xml:"Name"`
}

func main() {
	router := http.NewServeMux()

	em := emissione.Default()

	router.HandleFunc("/user", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		em.Write(w, r, http.StatusOK, User{Name: "Bj√∂rn Gerdau"})
	})

	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", router))
}
```
Use the following curl calls, to see the code in action:

`curl localhost:8080/user`

`curl -H "Accept: application/xml" localhost:8080/user`

## Extending emissione

Extending emissione is straight forward. Simple use `emissione.New(...)` to define a custom mapping, and if necessary implement
the emissione `Writer` interface. A simple implementation used by emissione itself is `SimpleWriter`, which simply implements
the `Writer` interface by delegating to a marshalling method, and setting the appropriate `Content-Type` header. This allows
for drop-in usage of Go's own marshall methods, such as `json.Marshal` and `xml.Marshal`, or [jsoniter](https://github.com/json-iterator/go).

## Compatibility

emissione-go is automatically tested against Go 1.13.X, 1.14.X and 1.15.X.
